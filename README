STATUS
    This module and related encoding format are still under development. Do
    not use it anywhere near production. Input is welcome.

DESCRIPTION
    Bifcode implements the *bifcode* serialisation format, a mixed
    binary/text encoding with support for the following data types:

    *   Primitive:

        *   Undefined(null)

        *   Booleans(true/false)

        *   Integer numbers

        *   Floating point numbers

        *   UTF8 strings

        *   Binary strings

    *   Structured:

        *   Arrays(lists)

        *   Hashes(dictionaries)

    The encoding is simple to construct and relatively easy to parse. There
    is no need to escape special characters in strings. It is not considered
    human readable, but as it is mostly text it can usually be visually
    debugged.

    *Bifcode* can only be constructed canonically; i.e. there is only one
    possible encoding per data structure. This property makes it suitable
    for comparing structures (using cryptographic hashes) across networks.

    In terms of size the encoding is similar to minified JSON. In terms of
    speed this module compares well with other pure Perl encoding modules
    with the same features.

MOTIVATION & GOALS
    Bifcode was created for a project because none of currently available
    serialization formats (Bencode, JSON, MsgPack, Sereal, YAML, etc) met
    the requirements of:

    *   Support for undef

    *   Support for UTF8 strings

    *   Support for binary data

    *   Trivial to construct on the fly from within SQLite triggers

    *   Universally-recognized canonical form for hashing

    I have no lofty goals or intentions to promote this outside of my
    specific case, but would appreciate hearing about other uses.
    Constructive discussion is welcome.

SPECIFICATION
    The encoding is defined as follows:

  BIFCODE_UNDEF
    A null or undefined value correspond to '~'.

  BIFCODE_TRUE and BIFCODE_FALSE
    Boolean values are represented by '1' and '0'.

  BIFCODE_UTF8
    A UTF8 string is 'U' followed by the octet length of the encoded string
    as a base ten number followed by a colon and the encoded string. For
    example the Perl string "\x{df}" (ß) corresponds to "U2:\x{c3}\x{9f}".

  BIFCODE_BYTES
    Opaque data is 'B' followed by the octet length of the data as a base
    ten number followed by a colon and then the data itself. For example a
    three-byte blob 'xyz' corresponds to 'B3:xyz'.

  BIFCODE_INTEGER
    Integers are represented by an 'I' followed by the number in base 10
    followed by a ','. For example 'I3,' corresponds to 3 and 'I-3,'
    corresponds to -3. Integers have no size limitation. 'I-0,' is invalid.
    All encodings with a leading zero, such as 'I03,', are invalid, other
    than 'I0,', which of course corresponds to 0.

  BIFCODE_FLOAT
    Floats are represented by an 'F' followed by a decimal number in base 10
    followed by a 'e' followed by an exponent followed by a ','. For example
    'F3.0e-1,' corresponds to 0.3 and 'F-0.1e0,' corresponds to -0.1. Floats
    have no size limitation. 'F-0.0e0,' is invalid. All encodings with an
    extraneous leading zero, such as 'F03.0e0,', or an extraneous trailing
    zero, such as 'F3.10e0,', are invalid.

  BIFCODE_LIST
    Lists are encoded as a '[' followed by their elements (also *bifcode*
    encoded) followed by a ']'. For example '[U4:spamU4:eggs]' corresponds
    to ['spam', 'eggs'].

  BIFCODE_DICT
    Dictionaries are encoded as a '{' followed by a list of alternating keys
    and their corresponding values followed by a '}'. For example,
    '{U3:cowU3:mooU4:spamU4:eggs}' corresponds to {'cow': 'moo', 'spam':
    'eggs'} and '{U4:spam[U1:aU1:b]}' corresponds to {'spam': ['a', 'b']}.
    Keys must be BIFCODE_UTF8 or BIFCODE_BYTES and appear in sorted order
    (sorted as raw strings, not alphanumerics).

INTERFACE
  "encode_bifcode( $datastructure )"
    Takes a single argument which may be a scalar, or may be a reference to
    either a scalar, an array or a hash. Arrays and hashes may in turn
    contain values of these same types. Returns a byte string.

    The mapping from Perl to *bifcode* is as follows:

    *   'undef' maps directly to BIFCODE_UNDEF.

    *   The global package variables $Bifcode::TRUE and $Bifcode::FALSE
        encode to BIFCODE_TRUE and BIFCODE_FALSE.

    *   Plain scalars are treated as BIFCODE_UTF8 unless:

        *   They look like canonically represented integers in which case
            they are mapped to BIFCODE_INTEGER; or

        *   They look like floats in which case they are mapped to
            BIFCODE_FLOAT.

    *   SCALAR references become BIFCODE_BYTES.

    *   ARRAY references become BIFCODE_LIST.

    *   HASH references become BIFCODE_DICT.

    You can force scalars to be encoded a particular way by passing a
    reference to them blessed as Bifcode::BYTES, Bifcode::INTEGER,
    Bifcode::FLOAT or Bifcode::UTF8. The "force_bifcode" function below can
    help with creating such references.

    This subroutine croaks on unhandled data types.

  "decode_bifcode( $string [, $max_depth ] )"
    Takes a byte string and returns the corresponding deserialised data
    structure.

    If you pass an integer for the second option, it will croak when
    attempting to parse dictionaries nested deeper than this level, to
    prevent DoS attacks using maliciously crafted input.

    *bifcode* types are mapped back to Perl in the reverse way to the
    "encode_bifcode" function, with the exception that any scalars which
    were "forced" to a particular type (using blessed references) will
    decode as unblessed scalars.

    Croaks on malformed data.

  "force_bifcode( $scalar, $type )"
    Returns a reference to $scalar blessed as Bifcode::$TYPE. The value of
    $type is not checked, but the "encode_bifcode" function will only accept
    the resulting reference where $type is one of 'bytes', 'float',
    'integer' or 'utf8'.

  "diff_bifcode( $bc1, $bc2, [$diff_args] )"
    Returns a string representing the difference between two bifcodes. The
    inputs do not need to be valid Bifcode; they are only expanded with a
    very simple regex before the diff is done. The third argument
    ($diff_args) is passed directly to Text::Diff.

    Croaks if Text::Diff is not installed.

DIAGNOSTICS
    "trailing garbage at %s"
        Your data does not end after the first *encode_bifcode*-serialised
        item.

        You may also get this error if a malformed item follows.

    "garbage at %s"
        Your data is malformed.

    "unexpected end of data at %s"
        Your data is truncated.

    "unexpected end of string data starting at %s"
        Your data includes a string declared to be longer than the available
        data.

    "malformed string length at %s"
        Your data contained a string with negative length or a length with
        leading zeroes.

    "malformed integer data at %s"
        Your data contained something that was supposed to be an integer but
        didn't make sense.

    "dict key not in sort order at %s"
        Your data violates the *encode_bifcode* format constaint that dict
        keys must appear in lexical sort order.

    "duplicate dict key at %s"
        Your data violates the *encode_bifcode* format constaint that all
        dict keys must be unique.

    "dict key is not a string at %s"
        Your data violates the *encode_bifcode* format constaint that all
        dict keys be strings.

    "dict key is missing value at %s"
        Your data contains a dictionary with an odd number of elements.

    "nesting depth exceeded at %s"
        Your data contains dicts or lists that are nested deeper than the
        $max_depth passed to "decode_bifcode()".

    "unhandled data type"
        You are trying to serialise a data structure that consists of data
        types other than

        *   scalars

        *   references to arrays

        *   references to hashes

        *   references to scalars

        The format does not support this.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Strings and numbers are practically indistinguishable in Perl, so
    "encode_bifcode()" has to resort to a heuristic to decide how to
    serialise a scalar. This cannot be fixed.
