DESCRIPTION
    Bifcode::V2 implements the *BIFCODE2* serialisation format, a mixed
    binary/text encoding with support for the following data types:

    *   Primitive:

        *   Undefined(null)

        *   Booleans(true/false)

        *   Integer numbers

        *   Real numbers

        *   UTF8 strings

        *   Binary strings

    *   Structured:

        *   Arrays(lists)

        *   Hashes(dictionaries)

    The encoding is simple to construct and relatively easy to parse.
    There is no need to escape special characters in strings. It is not
    considered human readable, but as it is mostly text it can usually
    be visually debugged.

    *BIFCODE2* can only be constructed canonically; i.e. there is only
    one possible encoding per data structure. This property makes it
    suitable for comparing structures (using cryptographic hashes)
    across networks.

    In terms of size the encoding is similar to minified JSON. In terms
    of speed this module compares well with other pure Perl encoding
    modules with the same features.

MOTIVATION
    *BIFCODE2* was created for a project because none of currently
    available serialization formats (Bencode, JSON, MsgPack, Netstrings,
    Sereal, YAML, etc) met the requirements of:

    *   Support for undef

    *   Support for binary data

    *   Support for UTF8 strings

    *   Universally-recognized canonical form for hashing

    *   Trivial to construct on the fly from SQLite triggers

    I have no lofty goals or intentions to promote this outside of my
    specific case, but would appreciate hearing about other uses or
    implementations.

SPECIFICATION
    The encoding is defined as follows:

  BIFCODE2_UNDEF
    A null or undefined value correspond to "~,".

  BIFCODE2_TRUE and BIFCODE2_FALSE
    Boolean values are represented by "t," and "f,".

  BIFCODE2_UTF8
    A UTF8 string is "u" followed by the octet length of the encoded
    string as a base ten number followed by a "." and the encoded string
    followed by ",". For example the Perl string "\x{df}" (ß)
    corresponds to "u2.\x{c3}\x{9f},".

  BIFCODE2_BYTES
    Opaque data is 'b' followed by the octet length of the data as a
    base ten number followed by a "." and then the data itself followed
    by ",". For example a three-byte blob 'xyz' corresponds to
    'b3.xyz,'.

  BIFCODE2_INTEGER
    Integers are represented by an 'i' followed by the number in base 10
    followed by a ','. For example 'i3,' corresponds to 3 and 'i-3,'
    corresponds to -3. Integers have no size limitation. 'i-0,' is
    invalid. All encodings with a leading zero, such as 'i03,', are
    invalid, other than 'i0,', which of course corresponds to 0.

  BIFCODE2_REAL
    Real numbers are represented by an 'r' followed by a decimal number
    in base 10 followed by a 'e' followed by an exponent followed by a
    ','. For example 'r3.0e-1,' corresponds to 0.3 and 'r-0.1e0,'
    corresponds to -0.1. Reals have no size limitation. 'r-0.0e0,' is
    invalid. All encodings with an extraneous leading zero, such as
    'r03.0e0,', or an extraneous trailing zero, such as 'r3.10e0,', are
    invalid.

  BIFCODE2_LIST
    Lists are encoded as a '[' followed by their elements (also
    *BIFCODE2* encoded) followed by a ']'. For example
    '[u4.spam,u4.eggs,]' corresponds to ['spam', 'eggs'].

  BIFCODE2_DICT
    Dictionaries are encoded as a '{' followed by a list of alternating
    keys and their corresponding values followed by a '}'. Keys must be
    of type BIFCODE2_UTF8 or BIFCODE2_BYTES and are encoded with a ":"
    as the last character instead of ",".

    For example, '{u3.cow:u3.moo,u4.spam:u4.eggs,}' corresponds to
    {'cow': 'moo', 'spam': 'eggs'} and '{u4.spam:[u1.a,u1.b,]}'
    corresponds to {'spam'. ['a', 'b']}. Keys must appear in sorted
    order (sorted as raw strings, not alphanumerics).

  BIFCODE2_BIFCODE2
    A Bifcode string is "B" followed by the octet length of the encoded
    string as a base ten number followed by a "." and the encoded string
    followed by ",". This is typically used to frame Bifcode structures
    over a network.

INTERFACE
  "encode_bifcode2( $datastructure )"
    Takes a single argument which may be a scalar, or may be a reference
    to either a scalar, an array, a hash or a Bifcode::V2::BIFCODE
    object. Arrays and hashes may in turn contain values of these same
    types. Returns a byte string blessed as "Bifcode::V2::BIFCODE".

    The mapping from Perl to *BIFCODE2* is as follows:

    *   'undef' maps directly to BIFCODE2_UNDEF.

    *   The "true" and "false" values from the boolean distribution
        encode to BIFCODE2_TRUE and BIFCODE2_FALSE.

    *   A plain scalar is treated as follows:

        *   BIFCODE2_UTF8 if "utf8::is_utf8" returns true; or

        *   BIFCODE2_INTEGER if it looks like a canonically represented
            integer; or

        *   BIFCODE2_REAL if it looks like a real number; or

        *   BIFCODE2_UTF8 if it only contains ASCII characters; or

        *   BIFCODE2_BYTES when none of the above applies.

        You can force scalars to be encoded a particular way by passing
        a reference to them blessed as Bifcode::V2::BYTES,
        Bifcode::V2::INTEGER, Bifcode::V2::REAL or Bifcode::V2::UTF8.
        The "force_bifcode2" function below can help with creating such
        references.

    *   SCALAR references become BIFCODE2_BYTES.

    *   ARRAY references become BIFCODE2_LIST.

    *   HASH references become BIFCODE2_DICT.

    *   Bifcode::V2::BIFCODE references become BIFCODE2_BIFCODE2.

    This subroutine croaks on unhandled data types.

  "decode_bifcode2( $string [, $max_depth ] )"
    Takes a byte string and returns the corresponding deserialised data
    structure.

    If you pass an integer for the second option, it will croak when
    attempting to parse dictionaries nested deeper than this level, to
    prevent DoS attacks using maliciously crafted input.

    *BIFCODE2* types are mapped back to Perl in the reverse way to the
    "encode_bifcode2" function, except for:

    *   Any scalars which were "forced" to a particular type (using
        blessed references) will decode as plain scalars.

    *   BIFCODE2_BIFCODE2 types are fully inflated into Perl structures,
        and not the intermediate Bifcode string.

    Croaks on malformed data.

  "force_bifcode2( $scalar, $type )"
    Returns a reference to $scalar blessed as Bifcode::V2::$TYPE. The
    value of $type is not checked, but the "encode_bifcode2" function
    will only accept the resulting reference where $type is one of
    'bytes', 'real', 'integer' or 'utf8'.

  "diff_bifcode2( $bc1, $bc2, [$diff_args] )"
    Returns a string representing the difference between two bifcodes.
    The inputs do not need to be valid Bifcode::V2; they are only
    expanded with a very simple regex before the diff is done. The third
    argument ($diff_args) is passed directly to Text::Diff.

    Croaks if Text::Diff is not installed.

  AnyEvent::Handle Support
    Bifcode::V2 implements the AnyEvent::Handle "anyevent_read_type" and
    "anyevent_write_type" functions which allow you to do this:

        $handle->push_write( 'Bifcode::V2' => { your => 'structure here' } );

        $handle->push_read(
            'Bifcode::V2' => sub {
                my ( $hdl, $ref ) = @_;
                # do stuff with $ref
            },
            $maxdepth   # passed straight to decode_bifcode2()
        );

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Strings and numbers are practically indistinguishable in Perl, so
    "encode_bifcode2()" has to resort to a heuristic to decide how to
    serialise a scalar. This cannot be fixed.
