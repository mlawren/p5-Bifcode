DESCRIPTION
    [ OBSOLETE! This module is kept around for legacy reasons, but all
    new code should be using Bifcode::V2 or later. ]

    Bifcode implements the *BifcodeV1* serialisation format, a mixed
    binary/text encoding with support for the following data types:

    *   Primitive:

        *   Undefined(null)

        *   Booleans(true/false)

        *   Integer numbers

        *   Floating point numbers

        *   UTF8 strings

        *   Binary strings

    *   Structured:

        *   Arrays(lists)

        *   Hashes(dictionaries)

    The encoding is simple to construct and relatively easy to parse.
    There is no need to escape special characters in strings. It is not
    considered human readable, but as it is mostly text it can usually
    be visually debugged.

    *bifcode* can only be constructed canonically; i.e. there is only
    one possible encoding per data structure. This property makes it
    suitable for comparing structures (using cryptographic hashes)
    across networks.

    In terms of size the encoding is similar to minified JSON. In terms
    of speed this module compares well with other pure Perl encoding
    modules with the same features.

MOTIVATION
    *bifcode* was created for a project because none of currently
    available serialization formats (Bencode, JSON, MsgPack, Netstrings,
    Sereal, YAML, etc) met the requirements of:

    *   Support for undef

    *   Support for binary data

    *   Support for UTF8 strings

    *   Universally-recognized canonical form for hashing

    *   Trivial to construct on the fly from SQLite triggers

    I have no lofty goals or intentions to promote this outside of my
    specific case, but would appreciate hearing about other uses or
    implementations.

SPECIFICATION
    The encoding is defined as follows:

  BIFCODE_UNDEF
    A null or undefined value correspond to "~".

  BIFCODE_TRUE and BIFCODE_FALSE
    Boolean values are represented by "1" and "0".

  BIFCODE_UTF8
    A UTF8 string is "U" followed by the octet length of the encoded
    string as a base ten number followed by a colon and the encoded
    string followed by ",". For example the Perl string "\x{df}" (ÃÂ)
    corresponds to "U2:\x{c3}\x{9f},".

  BIFCODE_BYTES
    Opaque data is 'B' followed by the octet length of the data as a
    base ten number followed by a colon and then the data itself
    followed by ",". For example a three-byte blob 'xyz' corresponds to
    'B3:xyz,'.

  BIFCODE_INTEGER
    Integers are represented by an 'I' followed by the number in base 10
    followed by a ','. For example 'I3,' corresponds to 3 and 'I-3,'
    corresponds to -3. Integers have no size limitation. 'I-0,' is
    invalid. All encodings with a leading zero, such as 'I03,', are
    invalid, other than 'I0,', which of course corresponds to 0.

  BIFCODE_FLOAT
    Floats are represented by an 'F' followed by a decimal number in
    base 10 followed by a 'e' followed by an exponent followed by a ','.
    For example 'F3.0e-1,' corresponds to 0.3 and 'F-0.1e0,' corresponds
    to -0.1. Floats have no size limitation. 'F-0.0e0,' is invalid. All
    encodings with an extraneous leading zero, such as 'F03.0e0,', or an
    extraneous trailing zero, such as 'F3.10e0,', are invalid.

  BIFCODE_LIST
    Lists are encoded as a '[' followed by their elements (also
    *bifcode* encoded) followed by a ']'. For example
    '[U4:spam,U4:eggs,]' corresponds to ['spam', 'eggs'].

  BIFCODE_DICT
    Dictionaries are encoded as a '{' followed by a list of alternating
    keys and their corresponding values followed by a '}'. For example,
    '{U3:cow,U3:moo,U4:spam,U4:eggs,}' corresponds to {'cow': 'moo',
    'spam': 'eggs'} and '{U4:spam,[U1:a,U1:b,]}' corresponds to {'spam':
    ['a', 'b']}. Keys must be BIFCODE_UTF8 or BIFCODE_BYTES and appear
    in sorted order (sorted as raw strings, not alphanumerics).

INTERFACE
  "encode_bifcode( $datastructure )"
    Takes a single argument which may be a scalar, or may be a reference
    to either a scalar, an array or a hash. Arrays and hashes may in
    turn contain values of these same types. Returns a byte string.

    The mapping from Perl to *bifcode* is as follows:

    *   'undef' maps directly to BIFCODE_UNDEF.

    *   The "true" and "false" functions from the boolean distribution
        encode to BIFCODE_TRUE and BIFCODE_FALSE.

    *   Plain scalars are treated as BIFCODE_UTF8 unless:

        *   They look like canonically represented integers in which
            case they are mapped to BIFCODE_INTEGER; or

        *   They look like floats in which case they are mapped to
            BIFCODE_FLOAT.

    *   SCALAR references become BIFCODE_BYTES.

    *   ARRAY references become BIFCODE_LIST.

    *   HASH references become BIFCODE_DICT.

    You can force scalars to be encoded a particular way by passing a
    reference to them blessed as Bifcode::BYTES, Bifcode::INTEGER,
    Bifcode::FLOAT or Bifcode::UTF8. The "force_bifcode" function below
    can help with creating such references.

    This subroutine croaks on unhandled data types.

  "decode_bifcode( $string [, $max_depth ] )"
    Takes a byte string and returns the corresponding deserialised data
    structure.

    If you pass an integer for the second option, it will croak when
    attempting to parse dictionaries nested deeper than this level, to
    prevent DoS attacks using maliciously crafted input.

    *bifcode* types are mapped back to Perl in the reverse way to the
    "encode_bifcode" function, with the exception that any scalars which
    were "forced" to a particular type (using blessed references) will
    decode as unblessed scalars.

    Croaks on malformed data.

  "force_bifcode( $scalar, $type )"
    Returns a reference to $scalar blessed as Bifcode::$TYPE. The value
    of $type is not checked, but the "encode_bifcode" function will only
    accept the resulting reference where $type is one of 'bytes',
    'float', 'integer' or 'utf8'.

  "diff_bifcode( $bc1, $bc2, [$diff_args] )"
    Returns a string representing the difference between two bifcodes.
    The inputs do not need to be valid Bifcode; they are only expanded
    with a very simple regex before the diff is done. The third argument
    ($diff_args) is passed directly to Text::Diff.

    Croaks if Text::Diff is not installed.

        You called "encode_bifcode()" with invalid arguments.

    Bifcode::Error::ForceUsage
        You called "force_bifcode()" with invalid arguments.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    Strings and numbers are practically indistinguishable in Perl, so
    "encode_bifcode()" has to resort to a heuristic to decide how to
    serialise a scalar. This cannot be fixed.

    At the moment all Perl hash keys are encoded as BIFCODE_UTF8 as I
    have not yet had the need for BIFCODE_BYTES keys or found a cheap,
    obvious way to distinguish the two.
